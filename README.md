# Jugend Hackt Blink Badge

This is the first verison of a giveaway badge for jugend hackt.
It contains a simple oscillator circuit made up of basic electrical components.

The circuit is called an astable multivibrator and one LED-eye is the inverted output of the other eye.

With two potentiometers and a screwdriver, you can adjust, how long one eye will take, till it gets switched off.


## How to assemble
The PCB contains footprints for two kinds of assembly:
1. Through Hole Technology
   Most of the parts can be put through the pcb, wich makes soldering easier.
   Beginners should take this way of assembly.
2. Surface Mount Technology
   Parts are layed on the surface of the PCB before soldering.
   Parts are smaller and can slip away while soldering. 
   This is more difficult to solder by hand. Recommended for advances solderers or if you have an reflow oven.
